# DSPy Project - Term Definition Generator

## 📖 What is DSPy?

**DSPy (Declarative Self-Improving Python)** is a framework for building LLM systems without manually writing prompts.

Instead of prompt engineering, you:
- Define inputs and outputs
- Provide training examples
- Define a quality metric
- Let DSPy automatically generate and optimize prompts

### Prompts are Learned Artifacts

In DSPy, **prompts are not written** — they are learned automatically from your data and metrics.

---

## 🤔 Why DSPy Exists

Traditional prompt engineering has serious problems:

- ❌ **Prompts are brittle** - Small wording changes break behavior
- ❌ **Improvements are manual** and non-reproducible
- ❌ **No clear evaluation** or optimization loop

DSPy was created to solve this by **treating prompts like trainable parameters**, similar to weights in machine learning.

---

## ✨ What DSPy Does

DSPy:
- ✅ Tries multiple prompt variants internally
- ✅ Uses training examples as supervision
- ✅ Evaluates each prompt using a metric
- ✅ Automatically selects the best performing prompt

**You never directly control prompt wording.**

---

## 🚫 What DSPy Is NOT

DSPy is **NOT**:
- ❌ A chatbot framework
- ❌ A UI or frontend tool
- ❌ An agent framework
- ❌ A LangChain replacement
- ❌ A tool for "better writing"

**DSPy is a backend LLM systems engineering framework.**

---

## 🎯 Project Goal

In this project:
- User provides a **term**
- System returns a **clear and correct definition**
- **No prompt is written manually**

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- Ollama (free local LLM) or OpenAI API key
- Internet connection

### Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Install Ollama (Free Option)

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Download Llama model
ollama pull llama3.2
```

---

## 🛠️ Step-by-Step Implementation

### Step 1: Define the Signature (Input / Output)

```python
# dspy_program/signature.py
import dspy

class DefineTerm(dspy.Signature):
    """Given a term, provide its definition."""
    
    term = dspy.InputField()
    definition = dspy.OutputField()
```

**Signature rules:**
- Only input and output fields
- No instructions
- No prompt language
- **Signature defines the contract, not behavior**

---

### Step 2: Create the Program

```python
# dspy_program/program.py
import dspy
from .signature import DefineTerm

def get_program():
    return dspy.ChainOfThought(DefineTerm)
```

**Use:**
- `Predict` for simple tasks
- `ChainOfThought` for reasoning tasks (✅ **Currently using**)

**Why Chain of Thought?**
- 🧠 Makes the model think step-by-step
- 📈 Improves accuracy for complex definitions
- 🔍 Provides reasoning transparency
- ✨ Better quality outputs

---

### Step 3: Provide Training Data

```python
# data/train.py
import dspy

trainset = [
    dspy.Example(
        term="API",
        definition="An API is an interface that allows software systems to communicate."
    ).with_inputs("term"),

    dspy.Example(
        term="Neural Network",
        definition="A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain."
    ).with_inputs("term")
]
```

**DSPy learns from input–output examples, not from prompts.**

---

### Step 4: Define the Evaluation Metric

```python
# metrics/evaluation.py
def definition_match(example, prediction, trace=None):
    return example.definition.strip().lower() == prediction.definition.strip().lower()
```

**The metric decides:**
- Which output is good
- Which prompt performs best

⚠️ **Weak metrics produce weak systems.**

---

### Step 5: Optimize the Program

```python
# dspy_program/optimizer.py
import dspy
from metrics.evaluation import definition_match

def optimize_program(program, trainset):
    optimizer = dspy.BootstrapFewShot(metric=definition_match)
    return optimizer.compile(program, trainset=trainset)
```

**This is where DSPy:**
- Tries multiple prompts
- Evaluates them
- Selects the best one automatically

---

### Step 6: Run the System

```python
# main.py
import dspy
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from dspy_program.program import get_program
from dspy_program.optimizer import optimize_program
from data.train import trainset

load_dotenv()

# Configure with free Ollama model
dspy.configure(
    lm=dspy.LM(model="ollama/llama3.2")
)

program = get_program()
optimized_program = optimize_program(program, trainset)

result = optimized_program(term="Artificial Intelligence")

# Print results
print(f"\nDefinition: {result.definition}")

# If using ChainOfThought, you can also see the reasoning
if hasattr(result, 'rationale'):
    print(f"Reasoning: {result.rationale}")
```

---

## 🔄 Complete DSPy Flow (One Line)

```
Signature → Program (ChainOfThought) → Data → Metric → Optimizer → Learned Prompt
```

**Prompts are outputs, not inputs.**

---

## ▶️ How to Run

```bash
cd dspy-project
python3 main.py
```

### Output Example:
```
==================================================
TERM: Artificial Intelligence
==================================================

Definition: Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the development 
of computer systems that can perform tasks that would typically 
require human intelligence, such as understanding language, 
recognizing images, and making decisions.
==================================================
```

**With Chain of Thought**, the model reasons step-by-step internally before generating the final definition, resulting in more accurate and well-structured outputs.
